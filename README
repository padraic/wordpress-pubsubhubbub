Implements a Pubsubhubbub Real-Time Publisher informing Planet Earth of your blog updates now, not later, with support for multiple Hubs and the most recent emerging practices.

== Description ==

Implements [the Pubsubhubbub protocol](http://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pubsubhubbub-core-0.1.html "the PubSubHubbub protocol") based on the current PubSubHubbub Core 0.1 Specification and any changes since its publication. [PubSubHubbub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/ "PubSubHubbub") is an open, simple web-scale pubsub (publish/subscribe) protocol capable of notifying one or more Hub Servers (e.g. the reference open source [implementation on Google App Engine](http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/ "implementation on Google App Engine")) of your blog updates so they may be forwarded to any of your feed's Pubsubhubbub enabled Subscribers as quickly as possible.

Any Pubsubhubbub enabled Subscriber can then receive an almost immediate update from any of your Hubs containing the actual update for immediate use. Subscribers know what Hubs to use when subscribing to your RSS 2.0 or Atom feed since this plugin will insert one or more links to your configured Hubs into these feeds.

WP Pubsubhubbub has the following features:

* Supports multiple Hubs configured from the settings page
* Pings all Hubs whenever you publish a new post
* Adds suitable Atom namespaced link elements for each configured Hub to the top of your RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 feeds
* Maintains compliance with the Pubsubhubbub 0.1 Core Specification and any outstanding amendments
* WP Pubsubhubbub utilises a Pubsubhubbub Publisher implementation which is fully unit tested for reliability and specification conformance
* Where no Hub is configured, WP Pubsubhubbub defaults to the reference Hub hosted on Google App Engine. This is a very reliable Hub.

As the specification authors state on the main Pubsubhubbub site, the protocol is decentralized and free. No company is at the center controlling it. Anybody can run a hub, or anybody can ping (publish) or subscribe using open hubs.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-pubsubhubbub` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter one or more custom hubs under your WP Pubsubhubbub Settings (optional - default hub preset)
